# Kaggle---Give-me-some-credit
Title of the project – Can I Borrow Some Money?

High level description of the project: what question or problem are you addressing?
The Kaggle competition requires participants to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

What type of data science task is it? (some example answers but not limited to) 
Classification using Supervised Learning

Data: Brief description of data. How big do you expect the data will be? Is amount of your data too big or too small? If you're web-scraping or collecting data, how long do you expect to collect the data? Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. 
Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. 
The goal of this competition is to build a model that borrowers can use to help make the best financial decisions.
The dataset is 150,000 rows and 11 columns. The amount of data is large but I may have to be very selective on which supervised machine learning algorithms I use. The data is collected from a past Kaggle competition.  

How will you analyze the data? What machine learning methods do you plan to use?
First, I’m going to begin by using EDA to get a feel if the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing. The machine learning methods I plan to use are Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Ensemble learning.

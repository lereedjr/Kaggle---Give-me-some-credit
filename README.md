# Kaggle---Give-me-some-credit
Title of the project – Can I Borrow Some Money?

The Kaggle competition requires participants to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

What type of data science task is it?
Classification using Supervised Learning

Data: Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. 
Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. he dataset is 150,000 rows and 11 columns. 

### Motivation

The goal of this dataset is to participate in a Kaggle competition is to build a model that borrowers can use to help make the best financial decisions.Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted.

How will you analyze the data? What machine learning methods do you plan to use?
First, I’m going to begin by using EDA to get a feel if the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing. The machine learning methods I plan to use are Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Ensemble learning.
